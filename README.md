# SiegeFX

![SiegeFX](siegeFX_logo.png)

An open-source, clean-room reimplementation of **Dungeon Siege** (Gas Powered Games, 2002) in C# / .NET 11 — loading the original game's data files directly rather than redistributing any of them.

> **SiegeFX requires the original game data.** It ships no copyrighted assets. You must own a copy of Dungeon Siege (GOG, Steam, or original discs) to use it.

## About

SiegeFX loads DS1's `.dsres` tank archives, parses the GAS template language, runs the original Skrit gameplay scripts on a clean VM, and renders ASP meshes with PRS skeletal animation. Spells, leveling, audio, and save/load are wired against the values DS1 ships in `formulas.gas` rather than reinvented.

It is **clean-room**: every claim traces back to headless audits over the bytes the original game ships, and the 2023 leak of the DS1 source is off-limits — you don't need it, just patient tooling. Every claim in the status below is backed by a `siegefx` audit you can run yourself: see [Receipts](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/Receipts) on the wiki.

Most of the groundwork is other people's — see [Credits & prior art](#credits--prior-art).

## Current state of development

**First playable alpha available:** [**v0.0.1**](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/releases/tag/v0.0.1) — a self-contained Windows x64 build. Unzip, run `SiegeFX.Runtime.exe` (standard GOG/Steam/Microsoft installs are auto-detected; otherwise set `SIEGEFX_DS1` to your Dungeon Siege folder), and see how far you can take the campaign. Please report what breaks via GitHub issues.

*Versioning note:* earlier tags tracked internal engine milestones and outpaced the project's playable maturity; the scheme was reset at the first playable build and now tracks progress toward **1.0 = a complete Farmhouse → Castle Ehb campaign**. The retired milestone notes live on the wiki's [Release Archive](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/Release-Archive).

**Alpha software.** This is a long-running reverse-engineering project, not finished software. The world's interactive mechanics are function-complete by audit, but the point of the alpha is finding out what real playthroughs hit.

**Working today:**

- **World & navigation** — every shipped region streams across boundaries; the live nav mesh drives click-to-move / click-to-attack, cross-region descents into cellars, caves, and dungeons, and Sims-style cutaway fades on the layer above you.
- **Party & companions** — conversation-driven recruitment; followers that fight with their own gear and trail you through six authentic DS1 formations; a per-companion character sheet (paper doll + backpack) and the Field Commands panel for orders and formation.
- **Combat & spells** — melee, ranged, and spellcasting enemies with template-driven spawners, pack alerts, and patrol routes; the full authored spell universe firing its own DS1 sfx effects.
- **Presentation & UX** — a DS1-faithful character creator, scripted intro cinematics (a non-interactive-sequence engine + storyteller narration), a rotating compass, a quest journal and HUD tracker, in-world vendors with retail store chrome, clickable doors, breakable props with authored loot, lossless quicksave/quickload, and streaming mood-driven music.
- **Options & comfort** — a fully wired options menu in authentic DS1 chrome (resolution, fullscreen/windowed with remembered window size, shadows, texture filtering, gamma, object detail) plus a modern Advanced tab (VSync, frame cap, anisotropy, MSAA, point-light budget, UI scale); Shift+drag HUD rearrangement with snapping; everything persists between sessions.
- **Weather & atmosphere** — the full mood system: per-location scripted rain and snow (the opening-farmland storm, the Glacern blizzards) with authored densities that drift like retail, linear mood fog on every region, wind-sheared precipitation, lightning with thunder, and the placed sound-emitter layer (trigger-activated rain loops, wind beds, waterwheels).
- **World mechanics** — the moving-node elevator system (216 lifts across 32 regions, lever- and stand-activated, riding the party between floors); openable chests and trapped containers; life/mana shrines that heal and revive; scripted progression gates (stuck doors that open on quest events, key-locked mechanisms, message-broken rubble); the boolean/counter logic-gizmo network quests gate on; and a campaign-wide completability audit whose "unhandled component" table now reads empty across all 81 regions.

**Under construction:** the end-to-end campaign, time-of-day (mood `[sun]` tables + hour-gated cricket emitters are parsed but parked), interior lighting fidelity, level-up feedback, and combat balance.

## Project layout

```
src/
  SiegeFX.Core       class library — file format parsers, no UI
  SiegeFX.Tools      unified `siegefx` CLI (tank info/list/extract, raw info/decode)
  SiegeFX.Browser    WPF asset explorer
  SiegeFX.Runtime    game / engine host (Silk.NET)
  SiegeSmith         modding studio & world builder built on the same parsers
tests/
  SiegeFX.Core.Tests unit tests that need no game data
```

## SiegeSmith

<img src="src/SiegeSmith/Assets/logo.png" alt="SiegeSmith" width="220"/>

The repository also ships **SiegeSmith** — the modding studio and world builder built on the same parsers as the engine. One tool covers the whole loop: browse and view every DS1 format (textures, models, **animations with live playback**, scripts with compile diagnostics), edit GAS with live validation, package and install mods — and a full **World Builder** that goes from door-stitched terrain through scatter brushes, patrol routes, triggers, dialogue, quests, weather, and custom imported art, to a one-click playable `.dsmap`. You can mod Dungeon Siege with it, or build an entirely new game.

**Start here: the [SiegeSmith wiki section](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/SiegeSmith)** — with the full [World Builder Guide](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/SiegeSmith-World-Builder-Guide), the [Making a Game from Scratch](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/SiegeSmith-Making-a-Game) walkthrough, and the [Modder's Guide](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/SiegeSmith-Modders-Guide).

## Build

```
dotnet build
```

Then from `src/SiegeFX.Runtime`:

```
dotnet run -c Release
```

See [Building and Running](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/SiegeFX/wiki/Building-and-Running) for game-data setup and controls.

### Tests

```
dotnet test
```

runs the unit tests in `tests/`, which use synthetic inputs and need no Dungeon Siege install; CI runs them on every push and pull request. The data-driven audits that check SiegeFX against the shipped game files live in `test-all.bat` (pass `--ds1=PATH` to point it at your install).
